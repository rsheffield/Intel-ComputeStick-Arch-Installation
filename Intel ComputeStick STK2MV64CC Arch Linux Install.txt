				(a)	Size = 8G
					(i)	Swap size set to 2x’s RAM capacity
					(ii)	If your device has more or less than 4GB RAM, feel free to adjust swap size
					(iii)	Depending on your needs, setting a swap size less than 2x’s your RAM capacity may be beneficial; however, determining whether this would be of a benefit in your use case is beyond the scope of this document.  There are numerous discussions on the web to help you determine what size swap is best for you & if you want to use a different size swap, I encourage you to seek out these resources.
